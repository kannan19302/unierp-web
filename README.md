**Layer L4** of the UniERP layered repository architecture
(`PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md` § 4.2). Publishes container image.

## Why it is its own repository

Tenant Admin Portal + Application Layer. Depends on the SDK, never on the API source.

## The invariant

**A repository may depend only on published artifacts of a strictly lower
layer. Never sideways within a layer. Never upward.** A cycle is not
discouraged — it is unrepresentable, because the lower layer's package cannot
name the higher one.

## Extraction status

Extracted from the `ERPSys` monorepo as § 14 Phase 3, with history preserved
via `git-filter-repo`.

**The monorepo copy remains authoritative.** Consumers switch to published
packages only once those packages are publishable; the monorepo stays buildable
at each extraction tag until they do. Rollback is a one-line `pnpm` override
pointing consumers back at the workspace path.

## Building a container image

A `Dockerfile` used to sit at the root of this repository. It was a copy of the
monorepo image, `COPY`ing `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `apps/` and
`packages/` — four paths that have never existed here — so it failed on its
first instruction. `unierp-idp` carried the API image verbatim, header comment
included. It has been removed rather than left in place: a Dockerfile at a
repository root asserts that `docker build .` works, and this one never could.

**The image is built from `ERPSys`**, which remains the authoritative build
until § 14 Phase 3 step 4 completes:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile web up -d web
```

This repository cannot yet build its own image. Its `package.json` still
resolves `@unerp/*` through `workspace:*` specifiers, which name nothing
outside the monorepo, and its scripts reach for `../../scripts/*`. Extraction
copied the tree faithfully; it did not make the tree standalone, and § 14 is
explicit that the monorepo stays buildable until every consumer has switched.

What unblocks a per-repo image is a package registry that CI can reach. The
self-hosted Verdaccio in `unierp-infra/registry/` answers on localhost only,
which is why the first cutover was reverted (`ERPSys` a96069e6): every
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` on a runner resolved `@unerp` against the
runner's own localhost and failed.

Shared services — PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO — come from
[`unierp-infra`](https://github.com/kannan19302/unierp-infra):
`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`.
