# ── local package build (DEV ONLY) ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two subpaths this app imports exist in the local packages but NOT in the
# published tarballs of the same version number:
#
#   @kannan19302/shared/auth-client        OIDC client, PKCE, useSession
#   @kannan19302/ui/shell                  PlatformShell, PlatformWizardGrid
#
# shared@1.0.5 on the registry has no dist/auth-client at all, and its exports
# map is the older catch-all `"./*": "./dist/*/index.js"` rather than the
# explicit "./auth-client/react" entry the local package declares. ui@1.0.15
# likewise ships no "./shell". Neither version was bumped when those subpaths
# were added, so npm resolves a package that looks correct by version and is
# missing the code — the failure surfaces as a Next.js "Module not found" at
# request time rather than at install time, which is why it reads as an app bug.
#
# This stage is deliberately IDENTICAL (byte for byte, and rooted at
# node:22-slim rather than at this app's `builder`) in every platform
# Dockerfile that needs the overlay. That is what lets BuildKit hash it to the
# same cache key and build shared + design-system ONCE for the whole platform,
# instead of once per image. Keep it identical, or every image pays the compile
# again.
#
# DEV target only — prod-builder still builds against the registry, so
# publishing stays the real release path and a released image never silently
# depends on a developer's working tree. Sources come from the `localpkgs`
# named build context (repo root, wired in infra/docker-compose.platform.yml).
