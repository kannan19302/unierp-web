  // They ship CSS modules beside their compiled components. As server-external
  // packages Node `require()`s them raw and chokes on the first stylesheet —
  // `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'`, pointing at the `.class` selector in
  // button.module.css, which reads like a corrupt build and is Node being handed
  // CSS and asked to parse JavaScript. Webpack has to own these so the CSS
  // modules are processed rather than required.
  //
  // The previous comment here warned that transpiling them hung the middleware
  // compile indefinitely. That was true in the monorepo, and it is no longer:
  // the middleware compiles in about a second now. The hang was the bind-mounted
  // Docker filesystem, not the transpilation — running natively (§ 12) took the
  // same compile from 962s to 1s.
  // The design system must be TRANSPILED, not externalised.
  //
  // It ships React components. An external package is `require()`d at runtime
  // and resolves its own React, so the server graph and the client graph end up
  // with two copies and every hook fails with
  // `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')`. Webpack has to own
  // it so there is one React.
  //
  // It could not be transpiled while its compiled output `require()`d CSS
  // modules; that is fixed at the source now — the design system resolves CSS
  // modules at build time, so dist/ imports no CSS at all.
